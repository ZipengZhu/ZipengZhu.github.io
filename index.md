# About Me

<img src="https://ZipengZhu.github.io/zipeng zhu picture.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Zipeng Zhu (Hubert, 朱梓鹏)**.

Greetings and thank you for visiting my academic profile! I am Zipeng Zhu, a graduate student in the School of Journalism and Communication at Nanjing University, where I am immersed in the vibrant world of data visualization, STS studies, human-computer interaction, and intelligent communication.

I have been fortunate to contribute to the scholarly dialogue through presentations at prestigious international conferences such as the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (**AEJMC**), the National Communication Association (**NCA**), and the International Association for Media and Communication Research (**IAMCR**). These experiences have not only honed my research skills but also allowed me to engage with a global community of scholars and practitioners.

My academic credentials include a Bachelor’s degree in Journalism from Shenzhen University, where I was recognized as an outstanding graduate and received **the highest special scholarship (ranked 1st in the university).** I also had the privilege of being named one of the Guangdong Province University Students of the Year and was awarded the "2022 Annual Outstanding Student Award" in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences database, "China Journalism and Communication Yearbook (2023)".

I am always eager to connect with fellow scholars, researchers, and professionals who share my passion for media, communication, and technology. If you're interested in collaborating or simply wish to exchange ideas, please feel free to reach out to me at zzpeng0216 [at] foxmail.com.
