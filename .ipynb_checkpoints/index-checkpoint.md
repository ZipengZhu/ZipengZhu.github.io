I've been fortunate to contribute to impactful journalism at Southern Weekly and Bytedance, where my articles have resonated with a wide audience. As the Chief Editor at Shenzhen University's Journal, I've enjoyed guiding a team to produce engaging content that has expanded our readership.I'm grateful for the accolades I've received, such as the Guangdong University Student of the Year and the Chinese National Scholarship, which are reminders of the support and opportunities I've been given.I'm always eager to learn from others and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of media and communication.
